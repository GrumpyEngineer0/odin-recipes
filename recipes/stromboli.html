        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            Stromboli is a type of turnover filled with various Italian cheeses (typically mozzarella) and usually Italian cold cuts 
            (typically Italian meats such as salami, capocollo and bresaola) or vegetables. The dough used is either Italian bread 
            dough or pizza dough. Stromboli was invented by Italian-Americans in the United States in suburban Philadelphia.[1] The 
            name of the dish is taken from the 1950 film Stromboli, which in turn is named after a volcanic island off the coast of Sicily.

            A stromboli is similar to a calzone, and the two are sometimes confused. Unlike calzones, which are always stuffed and folded into 
            a crescent shape, a stromboli is typically rolled or folded into a cylinder, and may sometimes contain a thin layer of tomato sauce 
            on the inside.
