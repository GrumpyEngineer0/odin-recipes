        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>A crêpe or crepe is a very thin type of pancake. Crêpes originated in Brittany, a region in the west of France, during the 13th century,
             and are now consumed around the world. Crêpes are usually one of two varieties: sweet crêpes (crêpes sucrées) or savoury galettes (crêpes salées). 
             They are often served with a wide variety of fillings such as jam or liquid chocolate. Crêpes can also be flambéed, such as in crêpes Suzette.
